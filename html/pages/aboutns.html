With both front and rear disc brakes, Bajaj Pulsar NS200 comes up with <mark>anti-locking braking system.</mark> This Pulsar NS200 bike weighs <u>159.5 kg</u> and has a<b> fuel tank capacity of 12 liters.</b>
		<br/><br/><br/>

		Bajaj Auto has launched the TVS Apache RTR 200 4V, rivalling 2023 Pulsar NS200 in the Indian market. The 200cc motorcycle benefits from updated hardware and improved rider aids.<br/><br/><br/>


		The biggest change on the 2023 Bajaj Pulsar NS200 is the addition of upside-down front forks instead of the conventional telescopic units on the previous version. Meanwhile, the suspension setup at the back continues to use a preload-adjustable rear monoshock. Apart from the suspension setup, Bajaj Auto has also revised the rider safety net. The 2023 Pulsar NS200 now comes with a dual-channel ABS as against a single-channel unit. Lastly, Bajaj Auto has revised the instrument cluster on the 2023 model, and the updated display shows information about the fuel economy along with a gear position indicator. The layout, however, retains a semi-digital console that comprises an analogue tachometer along with an LCD.
		<br/><br/><br/>
		The changes are limited to the upgrades mentioned above. Meanwhile, the styling remains unaltered, and the 2023 Pulsar NS200 continues to feature a single-pod headlight with twin DRLs, matching graphics for the headlight cowl, a fibre fuel tank with a 3D logo and shrouds that give the unit a muscular look, split-style seats, a two-piece pillion grabrail, an underbelly exhaust, and 17-inch alloy wheels. The colour choices include four options â€“ Metallic Pearl White, Glossy Ebony Black, Satin Red, and Pewter Grey paint themes.
